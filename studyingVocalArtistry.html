            I have loved singing since I was a kid. I distinctly remembering putting my <i>High School Musical</i> CD into my Hello Kitty CD player and singing along to all of Gabriella and Sharpay’s songs when I was 5. I loved sitting in the backseat with my Mom and learning all of the lyrics and riffs to her favorite songs from the 80s like “All Out of Love” by Air Supply and “More Than a Feeling” by Boston. I sang in Choir and musicals throughout elementary and middle school, and started taking voice lessons when I was in 7th grade.

            During my middle school years of singing, I learned a lot about breath control and proper vocal technique. I sang a lot of classical music and delicate soprano songs, never attempting to explore the power that I had in my voice. 
            When I was a sophomore in high school, I switched to a different voice teacher, who would tell me that I “was treating a Ferrari like it was a station wagon” with the way I sung. She helped me find a lot of power and resonance in my voice that I had no idea I had. The songs that she assigned me made me feel brave and empowered, leaving behind the damsels in the distress from the golden age for the bombshells of contemporary theater. Don’t get me wrong, I can still sing a mean “Think of Me” or “If I Were a Bell,” if I wanted to!

            Upon coming to Oxy, I auditioned for and was granted the Howard Swan Scholarship, which provides me with regular voice lessons with one of the many talented voice teachers at Oxy. I am fortunate to have been studying with Karen Hogle-Brown for four years now, who has coached me through some of the most important breakthroughs of my study. 
            I believe that my work with Karen has transformed me as a singer and artist. Although she is classically oriented in her teaching style, I have dramatically improved in contemporary musical theater and more popular musical styles as well as classical. The techniques that she has drilled into me, which focus on utilizing the body, consistent air speed, and finding the “pathway” between notes, work for all styles of singing. She focuses on helping me find the ease in even the most difficult songs. I now am able to access my belt and mix register more effectively and healthily than ever before, and can maintain the same resonance and tone from my legit register. This has made a world of a difference with my voice.

            I also had the opportunity to briefly study with David Sabella while I was in Manhattan for a musical theater intensive at Fordham University. David is a Broadway actor and vocal coach who helped me understand the many different ways the voice can be manipulated. He taught me amazing techniques that allow me to find the proper resonance and register for a character, so that I have more versatility and agility with my singing. In just five weeks, he had me accessing my low chest voice as well as whistle notes. He also taught me methods of maintaining my vocal health so that I can sing and rehearse for hours without damaging my instrument.

            Each teacher that I have had the honor of studying with has transformed what I am able to do with my voice. Even now, I am still learning and growing with weekly lessons and practicing daily. I can’t wait to look back in a year or two or ten, and see how much progress I have made!
