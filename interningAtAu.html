            One of my great sources of accomplishment and joy has been working at <b>Autonomic LLC</b> over the past 3 years. I started interning there the summer after my first year of college. I was extremely nervous because it was my first job within the technology industry, and I really wanted to make a good impression and create important work. I worked on the UI team at the Palo Alto office, where I worked with a team of about six people to develop the web apps for Autonomic users. I worked primarily in ReactJS, and, while I had learned JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I was not the most confident in my understanding of the React library.

            One of the things that I struggled the most with during that summer was navigating through the large amounts of code that existed within the web apps. As a college student, I was usually working on very small projects, so what I had learned in one to two week long projects in Fundamentals of Computer Science and Data Structures was harder to apply to hundreds of files of React than I thought. Due to the workflow of my team and the nature of React, everything was very organized to promote the reusability of various components that could be implemented and arranged to create beautiful pages. Although I was overwhelmed by the intricate network of files at first, I came to appreciate the mastery of it all, and learned about how the work I was doing in school was laying the foundation for far larger engagements.

            Another valuable lesson I learned in my first summer at Autonomic was how to participate in a company workflow. I firmly believe that every company has a different culture and each team within a company reflects that culture in their rituals. Autonomic is productive and innovative because it celebrates and encourages creativity, collaboration, and originality. These values were reflected in the way my team brainstormed and executed projects, and I enjoyed working on a team that was constantly striving to improve its products and invited me to share my thoughts.

            Flash forward to one year later, and I am in Detroit, Michigan, for the first time ever, gearing up to work on the Customer Support team as a Frontend Engineering Intern. I was so excited to be invited back to the company for the summer after my sophomore year to continue work in UI and frontend development for a team that consisted of four people. The Customer Support team at that time was fairly new, and I was the only person working frontend for it at that point. I was tasked with developing the help center for Autonomic, which was the hub for any and all questions/comments/concerns that a customer may have.

            You can find an in-depth reflection on my five-week internship here, but TLDR: I had an amazing time getting to lead my own project and the opportunity to explore my design and coding skills in a supportive and exciting environment.
            Summer 2020 rolls around and I am so excited to return to the Customer Support team … remotely, of course. I missed the way it felt to work in an office with other people, all working towards a common goal. I looked forward to our daily standup on Webex, where my team looked a little bit different than the year before. There were more faces on the team, including another intern who was also working in Frontend! He and I were assigned to an internal facing website that the Customer Support team as well as others could use to find all of the information they needed to respond to an issue with as little time and energy spent as possible. I was really fond of this assignment because I had a lot of freedom on the design element of my work and I got to see a project through from an idea to production. 
            When it became clear that my senior year of college was not going to be in person, I had to make a decision. As a theater major, I hated the idea of finishing my undergraduate degree remotely because I knew it would not teach me all of the lessons that it would in person. For that reason along with numerous personal ones, I decided to take a leave of absence for one year, and I was incredibly fortunate to be able to extend my internship with Autonomic for that year. I continued to work on the Customer Support team until December, where I was able to see the website I had spent so many hours on transform and grow. I was lucky to be able to experiment with lots of interesting tools and concepts now that I was no longer limited by the end of summer, and learned so much about design and coding. 
            After the new year, I returned to the UI team, where I saw many familiar faces from my internship years prior. This switching of teams made sense as the internal website I had been working on was finally in use and it was important that I learned more about the frontend development process now that I was a more skilled engineer. It has been a learning process for sure, as I am editing code that others have written instead of writing my own from scratch, but it is important to learn how to read others’ work. I also am working with other frontend engineers instead of backend/technical, so my pull requests get a lot more comments suggesting code improvements. One of my favorite parts of working with this team is seeing how a large project is broken down into smaller tasks, which are assigned to different people. It is exciting to me that a small component that I was working on last week will soon be a part of an exciting addition.

            I have learned so much through my 15 months and counting at Autonomic. My technical improvements have been drastic, as I have learned the JavaScript and HTML/CSS languages as well as the React.js, Zendesk, and MVC Razorpages libraries there. The largest takeaways, however, have been the lessons I have learned in collaborating with other people in a business setting, working towards long term goals, and seeing my ideas come to fruition. I cannot express enough how grateful and proud I am for the work I have gotten to do here, and for the enjoyment it has brought me!
