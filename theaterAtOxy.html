            In my six semesters at <b>Occidental College</b>, one of the biggest highlights has been being able to perform in five mainstage shows and work backstage on three others. I never cease to be impressed by the amazing talent, creativity, and hard work exhibited by other students and faculty members dedicating many hours of work to the show. Every production that I have seen and participated in at Oxy has excelled in both technical and performance aspects. I believe that my time working with Oxy’s theater department has helped me become a better performer and person, and I am continually inspired to take risks, push further, and work more diligently.

            In my first semester at Oxy, I worked as a makeup designer for the two shows of that semester; <i>Machinal</i> by Sophie Treadwell and <i>Country Music</i> by Simon Stephens. I had developed an interest in makeup design during high school and had experimented a bit on myself, but never for an entire production. <i>Machinal</i> was especially fun to design makeup for because it was set in the 1920s and the director’s vision for it was quite unique and abstract. The main challenge with <i>Country Music</i> was aging the main actor 10 years in between every scene in the show (there were 4 long scenes) in the 30 second scene changes. It was so much fun getting to learn more about makeup design as well as be a part of the production process for my first college shows!

            The spring of my first year brought me my first experience acting on the Keck Theater stage as Hermione in <i>The Winter’s Tale</i> by William Shakespeare. This role was more mature than any I had played in the past, and quite emotionally demanding. I fell in love with the pious, kind, and forgiving queen who, despite being wrongfully accused of adultery and having her two children ripped away from her by an irrational husband, remained compassionate and truthful. It was a pleasure to get to work with the accomplished guest director Patricia McGregor, who specializes in reimagining Shakespeare plays in the context of power structures in the modern age. I also enjoyed getting to wear a fake pregnancy belly.

            The next fall, I was cast in a modern adaptation of Chapek’s <i>RUR</i>: <i>U-R-U</i> by Julia Lederer. I was cast as the idealistic and headstrong Helen Spectacular, daughter of the President. One of the challenges of this role was acting in a new play that was under constant revision by the writer, because my lines were constantly changing. This was also a blessing, because the collaboration between the actors, the writer, and guest director Jessica Kubzansky allowed for a deep understanding of the role and the story. This was a unique experience. In addition, Kubzansky’s direction was both liberating for the actors as it was based on our impulses while also being beautiful. Every movement I made felt like a carefully choreographed dance but still felt completely natural. Not to mention that the ensemble work led by assistant director Perry Daniels made our cast run like a tight ship. We had trust and kinship for each other, and it often felt like we were a sports team setting each other up for success. A fun fact about this role though, was that I must have had about 60 pages of lines, which really tested my memorization skills!
            In my sophomore spring, I was in my favorite show I have ever been in. Part of it was that I already loved </i>Urinetown: the Musical</i> by Greg Kotis and Mark Hollman for its hilarious and ingenious lyricism and iconic music. Discussing corporate greed and squandering of resources through music and satire? Sign me up! I also got to play the ingenue Hope Cladwell, who inspired me with her optimism and heart. I loved getting to explore my comedic side with her naive and hysterical antics. In addition, I thoroughly enjoyed getting to work with Professor Laural Meade, whose direction allowed us to go big and beyond with the funny while still grounding our work in truth. Furthermore, being part of this cast was truly one of the greatest pleasures I’ve had as an actor. Everyone was so hard-working and happy to be there, and so talented! I loved getting to see the incredible dance numbers and hear glorious vocals every single night, time and time again. But most of all, everyone was so funny, I was having the time of my life watching my castmates crack up the audience every second. This show is the perfect example of why I love performing, getting to do fantastic work with incredible people, and to tell important stories in artistic ways.
            The next year brought me to the exciting and challenging play <i>Men on Boats</i> by Jaclyn Backhaus. This play takes you on a journey to the Grand Canyon, following the American men of the Powell Geographic Expedition who claimed to be the first to make that dangerous trek. The show deals with the implications of glorifying these settlers, while casting these nine white men with non-male identifying actors of any race or ethnicity. I played the obstinate, temperamental, and combative O.G. Howland, which was quite the change from my previous roles. I also was cast as Tsauwiat, chief of the Ute Tribe that lived in the land of the Grand Canyon long before Powell’s expedition found it. Guest director Deena Selenow worked with the actors to navigate the complicated themes of settler-colonialism and toxic masculinity. She also led us to the discovery of moments that ranged from ridiculously funny, heart-wrenching, terrifying, and awestruck. Emphasis on the ridiculous. One of the main challenges for this production was the rafting scenes, where we had to demonstrate going down waterfalls, men falling off boats that were worn like backpacks, and whirlpools. Choreographer Diana Wyenn led us through weeks of physical training where we discovered how to create texture with our bodies, helping us define rowing through rapids vs. calm waters vs. shallow waters, etc. By the time we got to the shows, the rapids scenes were delightful and tiring to perform, and I looked forward to them every night.

            In my most recent semester at Oxy, I was cast as Rachel in <i>The Bookstore</i> by Adam Szymkowicz. Rachel is the tired and depressed relative of the recently deceased Ida, who left a glorious and beloved bookstore in Rachel’s possession, and she is conflicted over whether to sell it or not. The director of this play was Professor Jamie Angell, who focused on the text. We were required to be off book before we started blocking, which might have been a problem for the sheer abundance of Rachel’s lines had it not been for my refined line memorization skills thanks to U-R-U. In doing this, it allowed us to really focus on what we were saying instead of worrying about what we were supposed to be saying. I enjoyed working with Angell because he constantly directed me in ways that I did not expect, completely changing the intention behind my character’s actions. This allowed me to avoid becoming stuck and encouraged me to keep making discoveries. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, we never got to perform this play, but I still learned a lot from the experience.

            These shows that I have been a part of have truly made me a better performer, student, and overall person. I cannot thank enough the people who I have worked with for bringing me such inspiration and joy. It is such a privilege to be able to work in the Keck Theater with so many creative, talented, and dedicated artists. I can’t wait until I return and audition for my next show.
